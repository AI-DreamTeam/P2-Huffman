# Huffman Coding

This is an implementation of the [greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) algorithm [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). It is able to recieve either a file or a string as input to be coded.
It will generate the following as output:
1. Relative frequency table for each symbol in the input.
2. The Huffman codes binary tree.
3. The original message, the coded message, and the compression eficiency for the input.
